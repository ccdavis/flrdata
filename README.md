Example code for my post "Fixed Length Data (Part Two)"

The 'explore_data.rb' script has additional examples of interesting queries on the full extract dataset discussed in the post. These will only work with the full dataset, which you can get from <a href="www.ipums.org"> the IPUMS-USA</a> data extraction service.

The 'import_helpers.rb' file includes helper functions to format result sets, format results as HTML and pivot tables, as well as functions to connect to a  database and rebuild the schema.
